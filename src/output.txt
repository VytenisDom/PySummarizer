Russia has for the first time admitted losses of personnel on the Moskva, the flagship of its Black Sea Fleet, which sank last week. Russia says the ship went down because of a fire on board, but Ukraine says it sank it with missiles.   As the BBC's Joe Inwood reports, Ukraine's Ministry of Defence says the wreck can be admired "without much diving".
